## Notes

Some of the challenges I faced when creating this web app was looking for great resources that were beneficial to the average developer. I did not want to provide resources that everyone knew about, I much more wanted to provide resources that people have never heard/seen before and resources. These resouces I found are so cool that even I will refer to them in the future.

A technical challenege I faced was figurng out the quirks of react and getting to learn the debugging and new format that it uses compared to javascript. Its something that takes a while to get used to but I managed to pull through with resources provided by codepath.
